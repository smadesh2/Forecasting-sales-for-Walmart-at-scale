# Forecasting-sales-for-Walmart-at-scale


Big Data analytics in the retail sector is enabling companies to create custom recommendations based on their purchase history thereby resulting in personalized shopping experiences and improved customer service. 

• **Objective**: Predict the weekly sales of each store - department combination using different factors that affect sales, such as unemployment rates, fuel prices, temperature, and holidays, in order to maximize resources and achieve maximum return on investment.

• **Description**: This project was executed as a part of IDS 561: Big Data Analytics. The forecasting of weekly sales for each store and department combination was required, which was extremely time-consuming if done sequentially. Spark's distributed computing capabilities, combined with Facebook's Prophet library, allowed the creation of hundreds of models to forecast sales for each combination of store - department while considering the effect of holidays at the same time.
